# HON
Code for generating Higher-order Network (HON) from data with higher-order dependencies
* Input: Trajectories / sequential data, such as ship movements among ports, a person's clickstream of websites, and so on.
* Output: HON edges in triplets [FromNode] [ToNode] [weight]

## Compatibility
The code is written in Common Lisp. Tested with [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/), but should run on any modern Common Lisp implementation.

Tested on Linux, Windows and Mac.

_A python implementation is under development. If you are interested, please let me know._

## Setting up environment
### Recommended environment
On *Linux*, follow [this tutorial](http://www.jonathanfischer.net/modern-common-lisp-on-linux/) to set up Emacs, SBCL, Quicklisp and SLIME 

After installing [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/), call ql:quickloads :split-sequence.

For other platforms, follow [this tutorial](http://cliki.net/Getting+Started)

### Minimal environment
Install SBCL and QuickLisp. 

## Workflow
### 1. Rule extraction

This corresponds to Algorithm 1 in paper.

Using Emacs and SLIME: open build-rules.lisp, press CTRL+C twice to compile, run (main).

Using Minimal environment: run sbcl, run twice (load "build-rules.lisp"), run (main).

#### Input file
Trajectories / sequential data. See test-trace.csv or traces-simulated-mesh-v100000-t100-mo4.csv for example.

In the context of ship movements, every line is a ship's trajectory, in the format of [ShipID] [Port1] [Port2] [Port3] ... 
> Notice that the first element of every line is the ship's ID.

ShipID and PortID can be any integer. 
> Non-integers can be used if function _parse-lists-for-integer_ is removed from (main).

Other types of trajectories or sequential data can be used, such as a person's clickstream of websites, music playing history, sequences of check-ins, and so on.

#### Output file
Variable orders of "rules" extracted from the sequential data. See rules-simulated-mesh-v100000-t100-mo4-kl.csv for example.

Every line of record represents a "rule", which is the (normalized) probability of going to [TargetPort] from [PreviousPorts], in the format of ... [PrevPrevPort] [PrevPort] [CurrPort] => [TargetPort] [Probability]. 
> If you want to output the number of observations instead of the normalized probability, in function (add-to-rules), change the dictionary of *distributions* to the length of the source nodes's value in *observations*, and remove (clrhash *observations*) in (build-distributions)

### 2. Network wiring

This corresponds to Algorithm 1 in paper.

Using Emacs and SLIME: open build-network.lisp, press CTRL+C twice to compile, run (main).

Using Minimal environment: run sbcl, run twice (load "build-network.lisp"), run (main).

#### Input file
The file containing rules produced by the last step.

#### Output file
HON edges in triplets [FromNode],[ToNode],[weight]
> Default weight is the probability of a random walker going from [FromNode] to [ToNode]. If you want to output the number of observations instead of the normalized probability, follow previous instructions.

Every node can be a higher-order node, in the format of [CurrNode]|PrevNode.PrevPrevNode.PrevPrevPrevNode

This representation (as comma deliminated network edges file) is directly compatible with the conventional network representation and analysis tools. The only difference is edge labels.

## Synthetic data
### Note
We use a new way to synthesize the data to allow us adding higher order rules during movement synthesis (it is not feasible to add rules beyond third order using the same setting in paper, because movements matching multiple previous steps will unlikely happen). 
### Script
The script synthesize-trace-mesh.py (run with python or python3) synthesizes trajectories of vessels going certain steps on a 10x10 mesh (i.e. grid).
10,000,000 movements will be generated by default.
Normally a vessel will go either up/down/left/right with the same probability (see function NextStep)
(vessel movements are generated almost randomly with the following exceptions)

We add a few higher order rules to control the generation of vessel movements:
2nd order rule: if vessel goes right from X0 to node X1 (X means a number 0-9),
then the next step will go right with probability 70%, go down 30% (see function BiasedNextStep).
3rd order rule: if vessel goes right to node X7 then X8, then the next step will go right with probability 70%, go down 30%.
4th order rule: if vessel goes down from 1X to 2X to 3X to 4X,
then the next step will go right with probability 70%, go down 30%.
There are ten 2nd order rules, ten 3rd order rules, ten 4th order rules, no other rules.

### Data
Data generated using the aforementioned script is provided as traces-simulated-mesh-v100000-t100-mo4.csv

### Rule extraction with HON
Use HON with a default setting of MaxOrder = 5, MinSupport = 5
It should be able to detect all 30 of these rules of various orders,
And will not detect "false" dependencies such as 5th order rules.
The result is provided as rules-simulated-mesh-v100000-t100-mo5-ms5-t01.csv, note that for illustration here (since we are not going to build a network now), in this file when higher order rules are detected, corresponding lower order rules are not added recursively.
If all preceding rules are added, following the algorithm in the paper, the expected result should be rules-simulated-mesh-v100000-t100-mo4-kl.csv.
The whole time to process these 10,000,000 movements should be under 5 seconds (unoptimized code, on single core, excluding disk IO).
